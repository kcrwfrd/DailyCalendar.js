# Daily Calendar
A simple day-view event calendar.

## Dependencies
* Underscore or LoDash, for rendering templates
* jQuery

## Development
Clone the repo, then `npm install && bower install && grunt develop` (also depends on the Compass gem being installed)

## TO-DO
* Enable paging between multiple days--it's not especially useful being limited to displaying the current day.
* Improve packaging of default pre-compiled templates.
* Improve performance of overlapping event function
